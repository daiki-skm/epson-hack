This is a repository of epson hackathon 2021.  

## Theme
The theme of this hackathon is "Accelerate smart cities with epson printer".  

## Background
Many of the procedures for companies and part-time jobs are still done with documents. In such cases, we talk about the documents via communication apps or web conferencing services. However, this means that when you write the document, you have to look for the record of the conversation in the communication app or web conference service and check the notes. Therefore, to solve this problem, we came up with the idea of putting QR codes on the documents to access those conversation records.  
Therefore, this repository is an attempt to develop such an application.
